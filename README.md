# Village-Street

Create a 3D viewing pipeline, including visibility.

This was a program assignment for CS 559: Computer Graphics, Spring 2018.

There are three sliders that control the movement within the space, changing the perspective as if the user is in the street themself.

    The top slider allows you to walk forward and backward on the street
    The middle slider allows you to turn your head, looking from the left to the right side of the street
    The bottom slider allows you to change your perspective of the street as if you are walking across it
